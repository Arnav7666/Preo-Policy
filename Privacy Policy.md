# Privacy Policy
Here, we have provided details about the data Preo collects and what its used for.

## What do we store
- Channel and Role IDs: Used to store server options such as dj roles, fixed text and voice channels, etc. This data is used to make the bot functional and customizable. Without this data, any kinds of customizations will not be possible. We will definitely not share or sell the stored data to any 3rd party companies or individuals.

## What do we do with your messages
- Your messages are not stored but used to make anti-phishing, anti-abuse, message logs, auto-mod and song request channel work.
- They are only stored, when an admin (of a server you have chatted in) creates a backup of the server. The backup includes last 95 messages of all channels. If you haven't chatted in there recently, none of your messages are stored.

## Concerns
- If you have any concerns regarding the data we collect, join the [support server](https://discord.gg/vFRrT48RKs). If you would like to delete your data, please remove the bot from your server, all the data will be automatically deleted.
